# Snowplow Terraform Provider

[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis] [![Go Report Card][goreport-image]][goreport] [![Release][release-image]][releases] [![License][license-image]][license]

## Overview

Terraform provider for emitting Snowplow events.

## Quick start

Assuming git, **[Vagrant][vagrant-url]** and **[VirtualBox][virtualbox-url]** installed:

```bash
 host> git clone https://github.com/snowplow-devops/terraform-provider-snowplow
 host> cd terraform-provider-snowplow
 host> vagrant up && vagrant ssh
guest> cd /opt/gopath/src/github.com/snowplow/terraform-provider-snowplow
guest> make test
guest> make
```

To remove all build files:

```bash
guest> make clean
```

To format the golang code in the source directory:

```bash
guest> make format
```

**Note:** Always run `format` before submitting any code.

**Note:** The `make test` command also generates a code coverage file which can be found at `build/coverage/coverage.html`.

## Installation

First download the pre-compiled binary for your platform from our Bintray at the following links or generate the binaries locally using the provided `make` command:

* [Darwin (macOS)](https://bintray.com/snowplow/snowplow-generic/download_file?file_path=terraform_provider_snowplow_0.1.0_darwin_amd64.zip)
* [Linux](https://bintray.com/snowplow/snowplow-generic/download_file?file_path=terraform_provider_snowplow_0.1.0_linux_amd64.zip)
* [Windows](https://bintray.com/snowplow/snowplow-generic/download_file?file_path=terraform_provider_snowplow_0.1.0_windows_amd64.zip)

Once downloaded "unzip" to extract the binary which should be called `terraform-provider-snowplow_v0.1.0`.

From here you will need to move the binary into your Terraform plugins directory - depending on your platform / installation this might change but generally speaking they are located at:

* Darwin & Linux: `~/.terraform.d/plugins`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins`

## How to use?

### Setting up the provider

To actually start tracking Snowplow events from Terraform you will need to configure the `provider` and a `resource`:

```hcl
# Minimal configuration
provider "snowplow" {
  collector_uri = "com.acme.collector"
}

# Optional extra configuration options
provider "snowplow" {
  collector_uri        = "com.acme.collector"
  tracker_app_id       = "terraform" # Default; ""
  tracker_namespace    = "terraform" # Default; ""
  tracker_platform     = "mob" # Default; srv (server)
  emitter_request_type = "GET" # Default; POST
  emitter_protocol     = "HTTP" # Default; HTTPS
}
```

Now that the provider is configured we can track an event!

### Tracking events!

Currently only one tracking resource has been exposed in the form of a `SelfDescribing Event` - the other pre-built options do not really make sense in a Terraform world just yet!

```hcl
locals {
  tf_module_deploy_event = {
    foo = "bar"
  }

  tf_module_context = {
    name    = "aws_module"
    version = "1.1.2"
  }
}

resource "snowplow_track_self_describing_event" "module_deploy" {
  iglu_uri = "iglu:com.acme/module_deploy/jsonschema/1-0-0"
  payload  = "${jsonencode(local.tf_module_deploy_event)}"

  contexts = [
    {
      iglu_uri = "iglu:com.acme/module_context/jsonschema/1-0-0",
      payload  = "${jsonencode(local.tf_module_context)}",
    },
  ]
}
```

To get around nested dictionary limitations in Terraform `0.11.x` we are using stringified JSON as inputs for the payloads.  In the example above we are leveraging the `jsonencode` builtin function to handle converting a Terraform dictionary into a JSON but you can also hand-craft encoded JSON strings if you prefer.

The above function lets you define a single event which is coupled with as many contexts as you would like to attach - when you run `terraform apply` it will send an event to your defined collector and on a `200 OK` response code from the collector log this as a successful resource creation.

### Publishing

This is handled through CI/CD on Travis. However all binaries will be generated by using the `make` command for local publishing.

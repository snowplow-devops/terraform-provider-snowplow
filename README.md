# Snowplow Terraform Provider

[![Actions Status][actions-image]][actions] [![Go Report Card][goreport-image]][goreport] [![Release][release-image]][releases] [![License][license-image]][license]

## Overview

Terraform provider for emitting Snowplow events.

## Quick start

Assuming git is installed:

```bash
 host> git clone https://github.com/snowplow-devops/terraform-provider-snowplow
 host> cd terraform-provider-snowplow
 host> make test
 host> make
```

To remove all build files:

```bash
 host> make clean
```

To format the golang code in the source directory:

```bash
 host> make format
```

**Note:** Always run `format` before submitting any code.

**Note:** The `make test` command also generates a code coverage file which can be found at `build/coverage/coverage.html`.

## Installation

First download the pre-compiled binary for your platform from the release assets at the following links or generate the binaries locally using the provided `make` command:

https://github.com/snowplow-devops/terraform-provider-snowplow/releases/latest

From here you will need to move the binary into your Terraform plugins directory - depending on your platform / installation this might change but generally speaking they are located at:

* Darwin & Linux: `~/.terraform.d/plugins`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins`

## How to use?

### Setting up the provider

To actually start tracking Snowplow events from Terraform you will need to configure the `provider` and a `resource`:

```hcl
# Minimal configuration
provider "snowplow" {
  collector_uri = "com.acme.collector"
}

# Optional extra configuration options
provider "snowplow" {
  collector_uri        = "com.acme.collector"
  tracker_app_id       = "terraform" # Default; ""
  tracker_namespace    = "terraform" # Default; ""
  tracker_platform     = "mob" # Default; srv (server)
  emitter_request_type = "GET" # Default; POST
  emitter_protocol     = "HTTP" # Default; HTTPS
}
```

Now that the provider is configured we can track an event!

### Tracking events

Currently only one tracking resource has been exposed in the form of a `SelfDescribing Event` - the other pre-built options do not really make sense in a Terraform world!

#### How to track: `self_describing_event`

```hcl
locals {
  tf_module_context = {
    name    = "aws_module"
    version = "1.1.2"
  }
}

resource "snowplow_track_self_describing_event" "module_action" {
  create_event = {
    iglu_uri = "iglu:com.acme/lifecycle/jsonschema/1-0-0",
    payload  = "{\"actionType\":\"create\"}"
  }

  update_event = {
    iglu_uri = "iglu:com.acme/lifecycle/jsonschema/1-0-0",
    payload  = "{\"actionType\":\"update\"}"
  }

  delete_event = {
    iglu_uri = "iglu:com.acme/lifecycle/jsonschema/1-0-0",
    payload  = "{\"actionType\":\"delete\"}"
  }

  contexts = [
    {
      iglu_uri = "iglu:com.acme/module_context/jsonschema/1-0-0",
      payload  = "${jsonencode(local.tf_module_context)}",
    },
  ]
}
```

To get around nested dictionary limitations in Terraform `0.11.x` we are using stringified JSON as inputs for the payloads.  In the example above we are leveraging the `jsonencode` builtin function to handle converting a Terraform dictionary into a JSON but you can also hand-craft encoded JSON strings if you prefer.

The above function lets you define a single event which is coupled with as many contexts as you would like to attach - when you run `terraform apply` it will send an event to your defined collector and on a `200 OK` response code from the collector log this as a successful resource creation.

Its important to define a base event for _each_ part of the resource lifecycle so that you can differentiate your events later and to be able to reason about where in the lifecycle a resource might be.

### How to stop Terraform turning primitives into strings

We are using a lot of stringified JSON as input above - the `jsonencode` function unfortunately turns a lot of our primitives ("floats", "ints" and "booleans") into strings through this conversion.  One way to get around this is to use regex to "fix" the payload after conversion:

```hcl
# Convert int, floats
payload_1 = "${replace(jsonencode(var.payload), "/\"([0-9]+\\.?[0-9]*)\"/", "$1")}"

# Convert "true" > true
payload_2 = "${replace(local.payload_1, "/\"(true)\"/", "$1")}"

# Convert "false" > false
payload_3 = "${replace(local.payload_2, "/\"(false)\"/", "$1")}"
```
 
### Publishing

This is handled through CI/CD on Github Actions. However all binaries will be generated by using the `make` command for local publishing.

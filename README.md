## Overview

Terraform provider for emitting Snowplow events.

## Quick start

Assuming git, **[Vagrant][vagrant-install]** and **[VirtualBox][virtualbox-install]** installed:

```bash
 host> git clone https://github.com/snowplow-devops/terraform-provider-snowplow
 host> cd terraform-provider-snowplow
 host> vagrant up && vagrant ssh
guest> cd /opt/gopath/src/github.com/snowplow/terraform-provider-snowplow
guest> make test
guest> make
```

To remove all build files:

```bash
guest> make clean
```

To format the golang code in the source directory:

```bash
guest> make format
```

**Note:** Always run `format` before submitting any code.

**Note:** The `make test` command also generates a code coverage file which can be found at `build/coverage/coverage.html`.

### Publishing

This is handled through CI/CD on Travis. However all binaries will be generated by using the `make` command for local publishing.
